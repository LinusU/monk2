# monk2

This is a spiritial successor of the excelent [LearnBoost/monk](https://github.com/LearnBoost/monk).

The main goals is to strip away most things and just make sure that the user never have to care about connection status. It wraps the native mongodb nodejs library and is suppose to always work with the latest version.

Right now it only provides very limited functionality but development should be very straight forward. It works with `domain` which `monk` currently dosen't.
